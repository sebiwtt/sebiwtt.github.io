## Why do we need online MLOps?
1. **Streamlined Development and Deployment:** MLOps streamlines the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models. It integrates best practices from software development and IT operations, leading to more efficient and reliable model deployment.

2. **Model Monitoring and Management:** Online MLOps tools provide capabilities for continuous monitoring and management of machine learning models. This ensures that the models are performing as expected and allows for quick adjustments in response to any performance degradation or changing data patterns.

3. **Automation:** MLOps automates many aspects of machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment. This reduces manual efforts and errors, leading to faster and more consistent results.

4. **Scalability:** As machine learning applications grow, managing them becomes more complex. MLOps provides the infrastructure and processes needed to scale ML applications efficiently, handling increasing data volumes and complexity without sacrificing performance.

5. **Collaboration and Reproducibility:** MLOps facilitates better collaboration among data scientists, engineers, and IT professionals. It also enhances reproducibility in machine learning projects, making it easier to track changes, version models, and maintain a consistent environment.

6. **Compliance and Security:** In industries where compliance and data security are crucial, MLOps provides frameworks to ensure that machine learning models comply with regulatory standards and are secure from potential threats.

7. **Faster Time to Market:** By automating and streamlining many aspects of the machine learning lifecycle, MLOps helps organizations reduce the time it takes to move from model development to deployment, thereby enabling faster delivery of ML-driven solutions to the market.

8. **Cost Efficiency:** Effective MLOps can lead to more cost-efficient use of resources, as it helps optimize computational resources needed for training and inference, and reduces the need for manual intervention.

ML Systems are not only ML Code. Train some nice model in a jupyter notebook and have it perform some inference is nice but it takes more to actually host a model in production and serve it to customers + monitoring

Concept Drift is a problem in production

There is high demand for toolchains that support MLOps end-to-end (especially online scenario)

Things like: 
- CI/CD Automation
- Workflow orchestration
- Reproducibility
- Versioning
- Collaboration
- Continuous ML training & evaluation
- ML Metadata tracking / logging
- Continuous monitoring
- Feedback loops

## Online Machine Learning 
Online Machine Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm continuously learns and adapts from a stream of incoming data. In this approach, models are updated in real-time or near-real-time as new data arrives, allowing them to respond quickly to changes and new patterns. This contrasts with traditional batch learning, where a model is trained on a fixed set of data and doesn't update until it's retrained with a new dataset. Online learning is particularly useful in situations where data is generated continuously and rapidly, such as in financial markets, real-time recommendation systems, or sensor networks.

## Delta 
Online ML is a topic I have some experience with and I am also familiar with a lot of DevOps tools and concepts (worked in automation). Also already worked on some tooling for deploying River OL models easily 

I find the topic very interesting, thats why i want to work on such tooling 

- Modell(e) in Production als eigenständiger **Microservice** (web) - z.B. als **Docker-Container**
    - Two APIs: **Public** (for training, inference …) and **Management** (Query Metrics, Parameters, update Model)
- Controller ist zentrale Steuerung all dieser Container
    - Realisiert überwachung aller Modell-Container und Logik für Versionierung, Tuning usw.
    - Config und neue Modell per GitOps?

Microservices for ML Models: This is a scalable and flexible approach. Each ML model is encapsulated within its microservice, allowing for independent deployment, scaling, and updating. Containerization, possibly using technologies like Docker, would facilitate this.

REST APIs:
    Public API for Training and Inference: This makes the model accessible for real-time predictions and allows for continuous learning by feeding new data. This API must be robust, secure, and capable of handling high throughput.
    Management API: This is crucial for MLOps, enabling monitoring, configuration, and control of the model services. Through this API, you can fetch metrics, update model parameters, and manage the lifecycle of the model.

Controller Software: This is a more advanced component, which could use principles from AI-Ops. It can automatically manage and configure model containers based on various signals like performance metrics, cost, time, etc. This could involve:
    Auto-scaling services based on demand.
    Implementing model version control and rolling updates.
    Automated retraining policies based on model drift or performance degradation.
    Resource optimization (CPU, memory usage).

Define the ML Model with River:
    First, define your model using the River library. River is excellent for online learning scenarios due to its incremental learning capabilities.
    Ensure your model code is modular and can be easily integrated into different environments.

Develop the Web Service Wrapper:
    Create a Python web service, using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI, that will serve as the interface for your model.
    Implement the RESTful APIs as you've planned: one for training and inference, and another for management and metrics.
    Ensure that your web service can deserialize incoming data for predictions and serialize the predictions as responses.

Containerize the Web Service:
    Write a Dockerfile that specifies how to build your container. This will include the installation of Python, the River library, your chosen web framework, and any other dependencies.
    Ensure the container exposes the correct ports for the APIs.

Test the Container Locally:
    Before proceeding to Kubernetes or any cloud platform, test the container on your local machine. Ensure both the APIs are working as expected.

Prepare for Kubernetes Deployment:
    Once local testing is successful, prepare your container for Kubernetes deployment. This involves creating Kubernetes manifests (like Deployments, Services, etc.).
    If you plan on scaling or managing multiple containers, consider using Helm charts for easier management.

CI/CD Pipeline:
    Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This will automate the process of testing your code and deploying it to production.
    Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions can be used for this purpose.

Monitoring and Logging:
    Integrate monitoring and logging solutions into your deployment to keep track of the model's performance and health.
    Consider tools like Prometheus for monitoring and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.

Security Considerations:
    Implement necessary security measures, especially for the training API to prevent data poisoning attacks.
    Use HTTPS for your APIs, and implement authentication and authorization as needed.

Documentation and User Guide:
    Document the entire setup, including how to deploy the model, how to interact with the APIs, and any troubleshooting tips.
    This will be crucial for users to understand how to use and deploy your models effectively.

## Future course of action  
Flexible Model Loading

Configuration Mechanism:
Decide on a mechanism for providing the configuration to each container instance. Options include:
Environment Variables: Easy to use but less flexible for complex configurations.
Config Files: More flexible, can be mounted into the container at runtime.
API Endpoint: An endpoint in your service to accept configuration details (like model choice) before starting regular operations.

Initial Configuration File:

Create a standard format for the configuration file. JSON or YAML are popular choices due to their readability and ease of use.
This file should include necessary parameters to initialize the model, such as the type of model, initial parameters, etc.
When the container starts, your web service reads this configuration file to initialize the model.

Management API for Runtime Configuration:

Develop a management API endpoint in your web service that allows users to update or redefine the model configuration.
This endpoint should accept new configuration parameters and apply them to reinitialize or adjust the model as needed.
Ensure this API has proper security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

Security: Ensure that both public and management APIs are secure. Authentication and authorization are key, especially for the training API to prevent malicious data injections.

Monitoring and Logging: Integral for understanding model performance and identifying issues.

Version Control: Essential for tracking changes in the model and its configuration.

Scalability: Your architecture should handle varying loads efficiently.

Testing and Validation: Before deploying any model, it must be thoroughly tested.
