Hello 👋

I’m a FullStack Software Engineer at Deutsche Telekom. In parallel, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at TU Darmstadt 🤖🧠. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science at h_da and worked as a working student at Deutsche Telekom, alongside freelancing to create websites for small businesses 💻🌐.

With a strong foundation in web development, I'm deeply passionate about machine learning and its endless possibilities. I’m originally from Darmstadt, Germany 🇩🇪, and enjoy bringing my technical skills and creativity together in my work.

Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid reader 📚, gym enthusiast 💪, and a regular at the cinema 🎬. I have a particular passion for specialty coffee ☕, both making and enjoying it. In fact, coffee is my all-time favorite beverage!

Feel free to get in touch with me at [mail@sebastianwette.de](mailto:mail@sebastianwette.de) or through any of my social links below. I'm always open to discussions on tech, coffee, or anything in between!

Cheers! 🎉
